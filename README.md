# Introduction
This course consists of a collection of exercises which serve as an introduction
to computer science. The material in this course uses the language C++, but is
transferrable to general most computer languages. The lessons below begin with
the most basic at the top, but as you go down, the lessons become more difficult
with each lesson building onto the previous one.

To do this course, you will need access to a computer with the GNU C++ compiler,
a text editor, and a terminal window. It is highly recommended to use a Mac or
Linux environment for your set-up since the commands can be used between both.

If you do not have access to a Mac or Linux environment, there are free Linux 
workstations on [Cloud 9 IDE](http://c9.io)
